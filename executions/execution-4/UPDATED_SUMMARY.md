# Iteration 3 Requirements - Updated Summary

## Document Version
- **Version**: 1.1 (Updated 2025-10-06)
- **Previous Version**: 1.0 (had incorrect Agent 3 requirements)

## Critical Changes Made

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

1. **Corrected Iteration Number**
   - Changed from "Iteration 4" to "Iteration 3" throughout document
   - This is the actual third iteration (after Iteration 1-2)

2. **Clarified Agent 3 Requirements**
   - **BEFORE**: Required implementing full 5-dimensional risk scoring with LLM
   - **AFTER**: Keep existing stub implementation (returns NEGLIGIBLE)
   - **Rationale**: Structure-only migration, no new functionality

3. **Emphasized Structure-Only Migration**
   - Added clear table showing current vs. target structure
   - Made explicit: agent behavior remains identical
   - Updated all requirements to reflect migration, not new development

### üìã Updated Requirements

#### REQ-I3-F-003: Agent 3 (RISK-ASSESS) - NOW CORRECT
**Previous (WRONG)**:
- Evaluate 5 risk dimensions (each 1-5 scale)
- Calculate overall risk score (1-25)
- Map to risk levels
- Provide GDPR compliance determination
- Detailed justification for each dimension

**Current (CORRECT)**:
- Migrate existing stub from `risk.py` to hexagonal architecture
- Continue returning hardcoded NEGLIGIBLE risk assessment
- Maintain same RiskAssessment dataclass structure
- Keep stub reasoning message
- No LLM calls required (stub implementation)

### üéØ Confirmed Scope

**What Changes (Structure)**:
- Directory layout ‚Üí Hexagonal architecture
- File organization ‚Üí Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Interface layers
- LLM calls ‚Üí Adapter pattern
- Entry point ‚Üí FastAPI REST API
- Dependencies ‚Üí Dependency injection

**What Doesn't Change (Functionality)**:
- Agent 1: Entity identification logic (from `simple.py`)
- Agent 2: Validation logic (from `validation.py`)
- Agent 3: Stub implementation (from `risk.py`)
- Prompts: Same prompts, just moved to domain layer
- LLM providers: Same providers (Ollama, Claude, OpenAI)
- Output quality: Identical results

### üöÄ Implementation Confidence

**BEFORE Updates**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Risky
- Unclear if building new features or migrating
- Agent 3 complexity would require significant prompt engineering
- Timeline optimistic for new functionality

**AFTER Updates**: ‚úÖ Achievable
- Clear migration-only scope
- Existing code provides blueprint
- No prompt engineering required
- Timeline realistic for structural refactoring

## Risk Assessment Updated

**Removed Risk**:
- ~~Risk 3: Agent 3 Prompt Engineering Difficulty~~

**Added Risk**:
- Risk 3: Async/Await Migration Complexity
  - Impact: MEDIUM
  - Mitigation: Incremental migration, test thoroughly
  - Contingency: Start sync, migrate async in future iteration

**Updated Contingency**:
- If timeline at risk: Defer FastAPI, not Agent 3
- Agent 3 is simple stub, no risk to cut

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Requirements now accurate and achievable
2. ‚úÖ Document ready for implementation planning
3. ‚úÖ Team can proceed with confidence
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 1 (Domain Layer) can start immediately

## Summary

The requirements document now correctly reflects a **structure-only migration** with **zero new agent functionality**. This makes the iteration:

- **More achievable** - No complex prompt engineering
- **Lower risk** - Existing code provides validation
- **Faster delivery** - Migration vs. new development
- **Better foundation** - Clean architecture for future enhancements

Agent 3's real risk assessment can be implemented in **Iteration 4** once the architecture is solid.
