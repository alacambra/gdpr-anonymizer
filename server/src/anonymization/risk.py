Agent 3: Risk Assessment (RISK-ASSESS)

    This dataclass represents the risk analysis of anonymized text for GDPR compliance.
    In the current stub implementation, all fields are hardcoded to indicate NEGLIGIBLE risk.

    Attributes:
        overall_score: Risk score from 5-25 (sum of 5 dimensions, 1-5 each).
                      Stub always returns 5 (minimum/safest score).
        risk_level: Risk category - one of: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NEGLIGIBLE.
                   Stub always returns "NEGLIGIBLE".
        gdpr_compliant: True if safe to publish (LOW or NEGLIGIBLE risk).
                       Stub always returns True.
        confidence: Assessment confidence level from 0.0-1.0.
                   Stub always returns 1.0 (100% confident in stub assessment).
        reasoning: Human-readable explanation of the risk assessment.
        assessment_date: UTC timestamp when assessment was completed.

    Example:
        >>> from datetime import datetime, UTC

        ...     overall_score=5,

    Assess re-identification risk of anonymized text (STUB IMPLEMENTATION).

    This function acts as Agent 3 (RISK-ASSESS), evaluating whether anonymized
    text is safe to publish under GDPR compliance requirements.

    IMPORTANT: This is a stub implementation for Iteration 3. It always returns
    NEGLIGIBLE risk to establish the workflow pattern. Real 5-dimensional risk
    scoring will be implemented in Iteration 4.

    Args:
        anonymized_text: The text after Agent 1 + Agent 2 processing, with all
                        direct identifiers replaced by placeholders like [NAME_1].
        mappings: Dictionary mapping original values to placeholders.
                 Not used in stub implementation, but required for future enhancement.

    Returns:
        RiskAssessment with hardcoded NEGLIGIBLE risk values:
        - overall_score: Always 5 (minimum risk score)
        - risk_level: Always "NEGLIGIBLE"
